This is the source code for Decompiling Android.

There have been some changes in the source code that are different from the book which are explained in the readme file in the appropriate tool directory.  

The code is also growing as we update existing tools and develop new tools.  Please visit us on twitter @decompiling or http://www.decompilingandroid.com for the latest information and links to updated code.

Thanks
